# EMS-Main

This repository contains an Employee Management System (server + Vite client).

Quick start

1. Install server dependencies

   cd server
   npm install

2. Install client dependencies

   cd ../vite_client
   npm install

3. Run server and client (example)

   # in separate terminals
   cd server; npm run dev
   cd vite_client; npm run dev

Notes
- Do NOT commit `.env` files or `node_modules/`. A `.gitignore` is included to help.
- If you want me to add more project docs (setup, tests, environment variables), tell me what to include.
